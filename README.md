# Titanic Survival Prediction using Naive Bayes
A repository containing code and resources for predicting Titanic survival using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

## Short Description
This repository provides a basic implementation of a Titanic survival prediction model using Naive Bayes, along with supporting files and documentation.

## Features
* Implementation of Naive Bayes algorithm for survival prediction
* Includes a Jupyter Notebook (`Day6_TitanicSurvivalPrediction_NAIVEBAYES.ipynb`) and a Python script (`day6_titanicsurvivalprediction_naivebayes.py`)
* Dataset (`titanicsurvival.csv`) for training and testing the model
* Documentation in PDF format (`Titanic Survival Prediction using NAIVE BAYES.pdf`)
